SVNCompleteSync

This programm syncs your local folder to a subversion repository.
All new files get added, deleted files will be removed.

There one single good reason to use this programm:
You have autogenerated files that you want to check 
into your subversion repository by your buildsystem.

I use it for my scripted database objects. I first delete all .sql files from 
the working folder. Then I generate the scripts into this folder.
After that I run SVNCompleteSync.
